## What is AngularJS?

AngularJS is a framework that lets you use HTML with special markup that syncronizes with your Javascript.

## Let's Build a Todo App
We should be able to:
- add todos
- remove todos
- mark complete
- bonus: clear completed

## 
https://github.com/MongooseDoom/angular-example/
End example is in the result branch

## Adding Angular to the Page
https://angularjs.org/ add cdn link to bottom of body
ng-app to html or body - This tells angular what the root element of our application is

## Test to make sure it's working!
Use ng-model on input

## Binding
{{ }} represents binding in AngularJS
Binding is a way to integrate your HTML with your data
Instead of being a one time thing, binding continuously updates whenever the expression evaluation changes.

## Controllers
Controllers connect your markup with your data. They allow you to define properties and methods.
